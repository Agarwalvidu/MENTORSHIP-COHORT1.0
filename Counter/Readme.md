I have added three buttons in my counter project.
When you will click on increment value will be increased by 1 and same will happen with decrement button which will decrease the value by 1. The reset button will reset the value to 0. 
I have added some keyboard functionalities too, you keyboard's page up button will act as increment button and page down button will act as decrement button.

Thanks to AssetMantle for this cohort and such amazing task.
